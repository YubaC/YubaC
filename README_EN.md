### Introduction

Since 2017, my comrades and I at Yuba Technology have been involved in the research or development of microcontrollers, wireless communication, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In the first few months of 2022, we began exploring accessible systems.

Accessibility is not far from us. In fact, it exists in every aspect of our daily lives. Every developer has their own reasons for getting into accessible systems, but I think we all share a common ground, and that is love. Care and love bring us together, dedicating ourselves to this great project.

So we put all our love into this work. I still often recall the deep shock I felt when I first viewed the "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines" written by the W3C organization. I seem to be able to experience the warmth brought by their love and care, just like the tide surging towards me from between the lines. I'm not sure what the authors of this guide were feeling at the time, but it was probably similar to us.

The only thing I can be sure of is that my colleagues and I will continue to pass on this love and care in our work, just as our predecessors have done, and pass it on to everyone.
